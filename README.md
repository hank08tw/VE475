## About Honor Code

If there is same questions or labs in the future, it is the responsibility of JI students not to copy or modify these codes, 
or TeX files because it is against the Honor Code. The owner of this repository dosen't take any commitment for other's faults.

According to the student handbook (2015 version),
> It is a violation of the Honor Code for students to submit, as their own, work that is not the result of their own
labor and thoughts. This applies, in particular, to ideas, expressions or work obtained from other students as well
as from books, the internet, and other sources. The failure to properly credit ideas, expressions or work from
others is considered plagiarism.

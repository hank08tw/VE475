This cipher is based on RC4 algorithm. This algorithm first generates a sequence of 0, 1, 2, ..., 255 and then mess it up. Using the messed-up sequence and the input key, we can get a keystream and can use it to encrypt and decrypt texts. 

In this cipher, we allow input of any length of plaintext which the content does not exceed the alphabet. However, when it comes to the ciphertext, we only allow a ciphertext of an even number of bits and can only have 0~9 and a~f. My default key is given as "EAV7xejGE9V7Vs98".Below is the usage of this cipher.

usage: c2 [ --generate | --encrypt <message> --key <key> | --decrypt <message> --key <key> ]
arguments: 
	--generate: generate generate a key
	--encrypt: encrypt a message
	--decrypt: decrypt a message
	--key: use the specified key to encrypt or decrypt
